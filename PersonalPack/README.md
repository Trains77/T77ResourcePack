# Trains77's Bad Resource Pack
This is a highly modified version of my personal resource pack to only contain things only things that I have made. I don't know why you would want it.

It changes the Cat Music Disk and turns into the Dog Music Disk which plays C418's Dog soundtrack

Changes the panorama to my Southhollow Base, Don't know why anybody would want that

Some modifications to the general language file
