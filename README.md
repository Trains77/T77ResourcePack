# Trains77's Bad Resource Pack
This is My Personal Resource Pack based on various other resource packs. If you want to use the resource packs used in this, go and download them from the links below and use them that way. Besides, I have modified the resource packs to my liking so my resource pack will either have modified versions of what the packs provide or might have had them completly removed from the pack.
